Passion Project

This is an iPhone app that allows two users (or teams) to face off against each other trying to win cards in each of the three categories: Mind (trivia or mental challenges), Body (physical challenges), and Spirit (spirit challenges).

First both players input a name and icon picture. The app then randomly selects card prompts from their respetive txt files and displays them on the phone. If the user is able to complete the challenge, they select the "Pass" button to place their game piece on the game board for that category. If they did not complete the challenge, they would select the "Fail" button and their turn is passed to the other player. The first person to make it through all three challenges wins the game.
